	<h2>Introduction to Web Design</h2>
	
		<p>
			This site is a companion for the Introduction to Web Design course. The four main topics we will cover are HTML5 (creating the content for your site), CSS3 (styling your site), JavaScript (adding some interactive features), and Responsive Design (making sure your site looks good on smartphones, tablets, laptops, and PCs). The focus is on best practices and accessibility.
		</p>


		<p>
			The best way to learn web design is with hands-on learning, so while this site looks good (at least I hope so), it is possible for you to see what the site looked like through each of the four steps.
